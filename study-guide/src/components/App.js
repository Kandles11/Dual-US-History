        <code>Uh Oh! Mason had some massive delays while trying to get the site up and running, so
            what that means is the dynamic features of the website will take a while longer. don't worry though! as soon as 
            the new website it up, it will be updated and fixed! Thanks for yall's patience!

        <p>So the study-guide is switching to a dynamic site ðŸ™Œ! This means easier uploading of answers, 
            cool dynamic features like search bars and pdfs, and way more! But this also means an entire API has to be
            created for it all to work. This API will be public, and of course, it will be easily accessable on this site.
            Once the API is running, the react version of the site must be built. This will also take time. The current 
            expected deadline is before 2021, but it is currently unknown when the transition will be 100% complete. Thank you
            for using Mason's Cool Study Guide!
